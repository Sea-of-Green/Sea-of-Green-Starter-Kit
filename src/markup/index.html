  <h1>Sea of Green Starter Kit</h1>
  <p>This project is a set of files with which to start your <a href="//sea-of-green.com">Sea of Green</a> web projects. It includes the baseline Sass files to start a project as well as favicons, logos, and this very homepage (which is a great start to your <code>HTML</code> as well).</p>

  <h2>Logos & Favicons</h2>
  <p>In the <code>/assets</code> directory, you will find the logos for Sea of Green, <a href="//handsonhydro.tumblr.com">Hands-on Hydro</a>, and the <a href="//sea-of-green.com/green-members.html">Green Member</a> program. All logos & lockups are available as <code>.png</code>s with transparency as well as vector formats (<code>.ai</code> & <code>.svg</code>). There is also an <code>.svg</code> file that contains all Sea of Green & Green Member logos as <code>SVG</code> symbols.</p>
  <p>The <code>/dist/images</code> directory contains an ungodly amount of favicons. This is to support a wide array of browsers & mobile devices. The code for all of the favicons is included in the head this <code>HTML</code> file.</p>

  <h2>Stylesheets</h2>
  <p>Sea of Green uses <a href="//sass-lang.com">Sass</a> with <a href="//bourbon.io">Bourbon</a> & <a href="//neat.bourbon.io">Neat</a> for stylesheets. We use a 6-1 architecture based on <a href="//sass-guidelin.es/#architecture">Sass Guidelines</a> with a <a href="//bem-info.org">BEM</a> naming scheme. <a href="//gulpjs.com">Gulp</a> handles our compilation, compression & concatenation needs (there's a default <code>gulpfile.js</code> located in the root folder).</p>
